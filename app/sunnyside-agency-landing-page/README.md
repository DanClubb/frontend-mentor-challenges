## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
