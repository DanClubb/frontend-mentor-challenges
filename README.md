# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solutions to some front-end coding challenges provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

As Next.js uses a folder based routing system, I have seperated each challenge into their own folders/routes. This allows me to host all my solutions in one web app and deployment.
