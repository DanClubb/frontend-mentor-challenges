# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solutions to some front-end coding challenges provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

As Next.js uses a folder-based routing system, I have separated each challenge into its own folders/routes inside the app directory. This allows me to host all my solutions in one web app and deployment.

Each challenge can be found inside the [app directory](https://github.com/DanClubb/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/main/app).

Inside each challenge folder, you should find a [design folder](https://github.com/DanClubb/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/main/app/news-homepage/design) containing design images for desktop and mobile view and the hover states, a [solutions folder](https://github.com/DanClubb/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/main/app/news-homepage/solutions) that contains screenshots of my solutions on both desktop and mobile, a [page.js file](https://github.com/DanClubb/frontend-mentor-challenges/blob/main/app/news-homepage/page.js) which is where you can find my html/jsx , a [CSS file](https://github.com/DanClubb/frontend-mentor-challenges/blob/main/app/news-homepage/news-homepage.module.css) with all my styles and a [README.md](https://github.com/DanClubb/frontend-mentor-challenges/blob/main/app/news-homepage/README.md) explaining the challenge
